======================
Django Multilingual Deep Space 9
======================

Django-multilingual-DS9 is a branch of django-multilingual,
forked from django-multilingual-ng compatible with
Django 1.2 and 1.3 with restructured core.

Parts marked as deprecated in django-multilingual-ng will not be checked for compatibility.

Django-multilingual-ds9 tries to be compatible with django-multilingual-ng whenever
possible. In the best case you can just replace django-multilingual-ng with
django-multilingual without having to change any code in your apps.

Only requirement for update from django-multilingual-ng is to either rename tables in
your database to remove underscore '_' before 'translation' suffix of update your models
Translation.Meta class to set db_table appropriately.

=== Tests ===
To run tests for multilingual you must set
 TEST_RUNNER = 'multilingual.tests.MultilingualTestSuiteRunner'
in your settings.
