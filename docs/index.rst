About
*****

django-multilingual-ng is a fork of django-multilingual with the main goal of
providing Django 1.2 support. As a side effect there's also an improved admin UI
as well as the deprecation (and replacement) of some annoyances.

*******************************
Relation to django-multilingual
*******************************

django-multilingual-ng is developed independent of django-multilingual, mostly
due to the drastic changes made to get it to work with Django 1.2's new database
API. If you want to use Django 1.1 (or earlier), you'll have to use django-multilingual,
if you want to use Django 1.2 (or higher), you have to, at least for now, use
django-multilingual-ng.
